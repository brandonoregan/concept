## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Python
- Django
- Postgres
  
The back end functionality of the project was built in Python alongside the Django framework. Django was the smart choice for web development due to its robust API building capabilities. The smooth compatibility between Django's data-handling tools and PostgreSQL, made PostgreSQL the obvious choice for our database system. JavaScript allowed for dynamic and interactive user experiences, enhancing the project's frontend functionalities and Boostrap offered a simple solution to ensure responsive design.
